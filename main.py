"""Final Year Technical Project - Anti-Aligning Robots

The control of macroscopic robot collectives is an important techniques in many technological
applications. At a fundamental level, it is important to understand how the rules governing the robot
interactions influence the emergent collective behavior of a robot swarm. In particular, seemingly
innocuous changes in the interaction rules can lead to drastically different collective dynamics. This
project will design and develop a robot swarm whose agents preferentially anti-align (in contrast to
classical models of aligning particles such as the Viczek model of collective motion), comparing the
results to theoretical models developed by collaborators at Brandeis University.
